# Grad_School
Repository for graduate school admissions data project
This repository contains files pertaining to a learning project for the Yammer group.
There will be a data file, with a few holes poked in it for us to fix.
Additionally, there will be R files with names set to help know which updates have been made.
The R files are VERY heavy in markdown as a 'talk through' of thought processes for data tidying.
The ultimate goal is to use machine learning on the data itself.
I am always open to questions and critiques!
